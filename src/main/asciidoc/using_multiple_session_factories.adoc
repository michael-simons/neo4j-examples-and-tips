Sometimes there's the need to connect to different datasources from within one application at the same time.
Those datasources may be of different type, but sometimes need to be all relational or in this case, all need to be a different Neo4j instance.
From an architectural point of view there could be a good opportunity to introduce different services per datasource but this is not the scope of this article.

== Problem

I want to use different Neo4j instances through different https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-ogm[Neo4j-OGM] session factories in my https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] application.
I have several domains, each with their own entity classes and repositories and each domain has it's own Neo4j instance.
I have added the https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-neo4j/[Spring Boot Starter Data Neo4j] but it allows only one connection and all my repositories use that.

== Solution

For this to work you'll need Spring Boot 2.x and the most recent release of Spring Data which is called https://spring.io/blog/2018/07/26/spring-data-lovelace-rc1-available[Spring Data Lovelace (RC1)].

In a standard Spring Boot 2 application generated at https://start.spring.io[start.spring.io] you would change the Spring Data Release train with the following property:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[[select-releasetrain]]
.pom.xml
----
include::{examples}/using-multiple-session-factories/pom.xml[tags=select-releasetrain]
----

Then the solution can be broken down into two problems:

1. <<step1,Provide a multiple connections to Neo4j>> by reusing the available https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/2.0.x/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/data/neo4j/Neo4jProperties.java[Neo4jProperties] used to configure Spring Data Neo4j in Spring Boot.
That way you avoid duplicating existing properties just for a second connection.
2. <<step2,Configure Spring Data Neo4j to use the correct session factory>>.

[[step1]]
=== Provide a multiple connections to Neo4j

The following code are in link:{examples-gh-ref-blob}/using-multiple-session-factories/src/main/java/org/neo4j/tips/sdn/using_multiple_session_factories/domain1/Domain1Config.java[Domain1Config.java] and link:{examples-gh-ref-blob}/using-multiple-session-factories/src/main/java/org/neo4j/tips/sdn/using_multiple_session_factories/domain2/Domain2Config.java[Domain2Config.java] of this articles example project link:{examples-gh-ref}/using-multiple-session-factories[`using-multiple-session-factories`].

We are dealing with the following configuration of our Spring Boot application

[source,properties]
[[spring-data-neo4j-configuration]]
.application.properties
----
include::{examples}/using-multiple-session-factories/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=spring-data-neo4j-configuration]
----

As you see we're using the *default* properties for our domain 1.
The configuration for domain 2 looks very similar, but has an additional prefix inside their name.
They are in fact both mapped to the same configuration class.
How are we doing that?

`Domain1Config` does something that is normally done by the `spring-boot-starter-data-neo4j`, it creates an instance of `Neo4jProperties`:


[source,java,indent=0]
[[domain-1-config-properties]]
.Domain1Config.java
----
include::{examples}/using-multiple-session-factories/src/main/java/org/neo4j/tips/sdn/using_multiple_session_factories/domain1/Domain1Config.java[tags=using-default-properties]
----

The property class uses `@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "spring.data.neo4j")` which maps configuration values (either properties, environment, config server, whatever) to property beans.
This property bean is marked as primary and given a name that is the same as the method name creating it (`neo4jPropertiesDomain1`).

With that property we'll create the OGM configuration, session factory and transaction manager as needed for instance 1, pretty much as the starter normally does.
The starter will back off from providing those beans if they already exists.

[source,java,indent=0]
[[creating-necessary-beans-from-properties-domain1]]
.Domain1Config.java
----
include::{examples}/using-multiple-session-factories/src/main/java/org/neo4j/tips/sdn/using_multiple_session_factories/domain1/Domain1Config.java[tags=creating-necessary-beans-from-properties-domain1]
----
<1> Uses a static constant to provide a dedicated name for the session factory.
<2> A static constant containing the fully qualified name of domain 1 java package.
<3> Same as in 1 but for the transaction manager.

Now for the second instance. We'll have a look at the full configuration class to get whole picture:

[source,java,indent=0]
[[full-config-domain2]]
.Domain2Config.java
----
include::{examples}/using-multiple-session-factories/src/main/java/org/neo4j/tips/sdn/using_multiple_session_factories/domain2/Domain2Config.java[tags=domain2-config]
----
<1> Spring Data Neo4j has always provided an injectable, shared session, much like Spring Data JPA with the EntityManager. If there are two Neo4j-OGM session factories, there are two sessions as well. If you don't provide a name as we did here, the session get's qualified with the name of the session factory itself.
<2> See below, we create another instance of `Neo4jProperties`.

Many people don't know the fact, that one can use Spring Boots configuration properties mechanismen not only on classes, but also on `@Bean`-factory methods. It maps all properties from your configuration with the specified prefix to properties of the bean. In this case, the properties from <<spring-data-neo4j-configuration>> are mapped to the bean. The rest of the configuration is - apart from different names - identically to the one for domain 1.


[[step2]]
=== Configure Spring Data Neo4j to use the correct session factory

Having those connections in place we enable Neo4j repositories for "domain1" and "domain2" against the correct instances in our `@Configuration` classes as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
[[customizing-neo4j-repositories1]]
.Domain1Config.java
----
include::{examples}/using-multiple-session-factories/src/main/java/org/neo4j/tips/sdn/using_multiple_session_factories/domain1/Domain1Config.java[tags=customizing-neo4j-repositories1]
----
<1> Specificies the Neo4j OGM Session factory to use instead the default (named `sessionFactory` which is no longer instantiated through the starter as we provided our own).
<2> Use that session factory only for the given base package. Note that this is the same as when opening the session factory.
<3> Also, use the correct transaction manager.

The repositories for domain 2 are configured in the same way. You see the configuration already in <<full-config-domain2>>.

=== How to use this?

==== On the Spring Data level

Given link:{examples-gh-ref-blob}/using-multiple-session-factories/src/main/java/org/neo4j/tips/sdn/using_multiple_session_factories/domain1/FooRepository.java[FooRepository.java] and link:{examples-gh-ref-blob}/using-multiple-session-factories/src/main/java/org/neo4j/tips/sdn/using_multiple_session_factories/domain2/BarRepository.java[BarRepository.java] in their respective Java-packages, you are using the different connections completely transparent as shown in <<repository-usage>>.

[source,java,indent=0]
[[repository-usage]]
.Domain2Config.java
----
include::{examples}/using-multiple-session-factories/src/main/java/org/neo4j/tips/sdn/using_multiple_session_factories/DemoServiceUsingRepositories.java[tags=repository-usage]
----

==== On the session level

You can use both the session factory or a session. They must be however qualified at their injection points as we have several matching beans of types `SessionFactory` and `Session`:

[source,java,indent=0]
[[session-usage]]
.Domain2Config.java
----
include::{examples}/using-multiple-session-factories/src/main/java/org/neo4j/tips/sdn/using_multiple_session_factories/DemoServiceUsingSession.java[tags=session-usage]
----
<1> Use the qualifier based on the session factories name
<2> Use the name configured in <<full-config-domain2>>.

== About the example

The example uses two server instances provided via Docker, so that you can convince yourself that the setup works as expected.
For your convience, both instances can be started and stopped via a single Maven command (`./mvnw docker:start`and `./mvnw docker:stop` respectivly).
You can access them at http://localhost:7474[localhost:7474] and http://localhost:7475[localhost:7475].

== Added bonus: Spring Boots configuration processor

Applying `@ConfigurationProperties` to an `@Bean` method is subject to the generation of configurational metadata as well.
Read about that topic https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/configuration-metadata.html[here].
In short: It's enough to add `spring-boot-configuration-processor` as an optional dependency to your build

[source,xml,indent=0]
[[spring-boot-configuration-processor]]
.pom.xml
----
include::{examples}/using-multiple-session-factories/pom.xml[tags=spring-boot-configuration-processor]
----

to generate metadata about your configuration properties (being completly your own or reused as we did).
This metadata is read by any of the major IDEs (like NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA or Spring Tool Suite), as shown in the following picture:
